House suggestion: Dear Clare H from North Texas,

It was so long ago, I kept telling myself it wouldn’t make any difference, that it didn’t matter, that no-one cared, but that was before I had my three beautiful daughters who have changed my whole life around, and now all I can think about is what we did to you and all those other girls back when we were young and thought we ruled the world.

I’m sick to my stomach to think something like that could happen to my girls but everywhere I look I see the same things going on to innocent girls and it seems to be getting worse not better.

Clare, you were one of the lucky ones that didn’t end up broken on the streets or on drugs, or dead. Remember Gillian who was so smart, top of the class at everything, dead at 26. I guess being blamed for what we did to her, and then condemned by the people she loved the most in the world was just too much. It would have been too much for all of us cowards. Yes, that’s what we were, and still are.

I just want to ask your forgiveness Clare. I know it may not be forthcoming any time soon, but I am taking full responsibility for my actions which I am entirely to blame for.

Please forgive me.

David Z.
