Dear body,

I was young and my parents were going through a divorce. It was easy to get hooked into those chat rooms, especially when a man told me I was beautiful.

Hearing that was like a shot of heroin to my 13-year-old brain.

I really don’t know the exact thing that started me on the path to self-mutilation, but I found myself very quickly from age 12 onwards chatting online with - what I know now were - adult men pretending to be boys my age. Their talk got so sexual, so quickly, it was kind of overwhelming. They always told me how male I was; how I must be a gay boy.

It was easy to fly headlong into puberty blockers, then hormones, then removing my breasts, womb, and ovaries. I didn't get a penis, that was a step too far that didn't really make any sense given it was never gonna actually work and some of my friends had got gangrene from it. Looking back I can’t believe I thought any of it made sense.

Now I’m 27 and broken. There is no normal future for me with a family and children. The hormones have broken my organs and bones, my waterworks are those of a 80 year old woman - they tell me - and I rattle due to the amount of medication I’m taking for all the side effects of transitioning.

I’m more suicidal now than I ever was as a kid.

I’m so sorry body. For what I did to you. I wish I hadn’t done those things I can never undo.

Please forgive me.

A detrans woman.
