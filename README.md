# forgivenet-frontend

web3js frontend for Solidity forgiveness app running on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Develop branch

This is the develop branch which currently reflects the `goerli` set up. However, we are working on making this the local dev branch. 

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo.
2. `cd` into the root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Checkout the branch you want to work on: `mainnet`, `goerli`, or `sepolia`.
5. `cd` into the `src` directory and run `npx http-server` to spin up the site locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
6. The network branches are read-only. Create a new branch from develop to experiment with new frontends.
